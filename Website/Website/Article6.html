            <h2> Preme </h2>
            <p> Raynford Humphrey (born January 8, 1986), better known by his stage name Preme (formerly P Reign), is a Canadian rapper, singer and songwriter. He grew to fame with his single 'DnF' featuring Drake and Future. His debut album 'Light Of Day' debuted at 42 on the billboard charts and in my opinion, it is a very easy listen.Though he spends a lot of time with Drake and other OVO members, he is not actually signed to OVO, though people thought he was. Preme actually speaks on this saying "I don't work this hard, night in and night out, to not be able to be respected and hold my own weight.I have big respect for Drake but i dont want to be known as just Drake's friend."</p>

            <h2> Bryson Tiller </h2>
            <p> Bryson Djuan Tiller (born January 2, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and rapper. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he started his career in 2011, releasing the debut mixtape titled Killer Instinct Vol.1. Tiller initially gained notable recognition following the release of his debut single, "Don't", which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. The record's success led to a deal with RCA Records and he released his debut studio album, Trapsoul in October 2015, which reached number eight on the Billboard 200. The album's second single "Exchange" has peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned him a Grammy nomination. He then released his second studio album 'True to Self' which featured the single 'Run Me Dry'. During the recording of True to Self, Tiller has been struggling with depression, which according to him can be heard in the music and was the reason of the album's disappointing commercial performance.Tiller says he will "probably never" do video interview, because he want to be a "shadowy figure".[48] According to Justin Charity of The Ringer, "Tiller’s lack of a full-time public persona is one of the young R&B singer’s most endearing qualities". Like Preme, he had success without the help of Drake, who wanted to sign Tiller to his label, OVO, with Tiller rejecting. </p>
