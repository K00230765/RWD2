        <h1> Song Recommendations</h1>
            <h2> Octavion - Party Here </h2>
            <p> Octavian was born in France, raised in Southeast London, and first debuted in 2016 with a promising debut mixtape, 22.But the song itself is even more remarkable. Over a minimal, bass-heavy beat that nods subtly toward garage and dancehall, Octavian holds court with a delivery that bridges grime’s hardscrabble tone with the melodic, half-sung style of U.S. pop rap. His voice cracks as he reaches for notes, but this only adds to his everyman charm. He sounds weary beyond his years, almost as if he’s surprised to still be here, when he raps “Me and my team, we know what it means to survive.” “Party Here” is all about juxtaposition—of British and American sounds, somber verses and ecstatic choruses, posturing and introspection. In synthesizing these disparate elements, Octavian has arrived at something that feels vital and new, a sound that, perhaps, Southeast London can call its own.</p>
            
            <p> Overnight, Drake had posted Instagram photos captioned by lyrics from “Party Here,” the 21-year-old singer-rapper’s breakout song, recorded last year in a friend’s living room. A few days later, Octavian’s phone started firing up again after Drake was filmed singing “Party Here” at a Golden Globes after-party. “Your mandem are getting too close/Careful how you approach me and my bros,” the pop star slurred along, jabbing his glass at the lens as Octavian’s anthem blasted in the background.But if Drake’s co-sign spotlighted that freewheeling appeal, it also drilled home Octavian’s belief in independence. “It proves that it’s all possible,” he says cautiously. “But I don’t want anything more from him.” And he stuck to that, with the song video being created with allegedly just £50—a minor miracle, considering how visually rich, colorful, and jubilant the clip is. </p>

        <h2> Tory Lanez - In for it </h2>
        
        <p> Tory Lanez brought his #FargoFridays series back with new heat “In For It”, which was produced by RL Grime. It was also featured as the second track off his 2015 EP, Cruel Intentions. Daystar Peterson, better known as Tory Lanez or sometimes by his alter ego ‘Argentina Fargo’ was born on July 27th, 1992. The name “Tory” comes from Brooklyn rapper Notorious B.I.G. and “Lanez” is a nickname he had when he got “ from playing chicken in street.” Despite hailing from Toronto, Tory was brought up in Miami, Florida; and during his later life, California. Lanez has been rapping since the age of nine.TThroughout his career, he began to sing more than rap, though his singing gets a lot of criticism for his use of autotune. But, this track it works perfect. The autotune works very well with the dark sounding r&b beat. Have a listen for yourself! </p>

        <h2> Yung Pinch - When I get Home (Hotel Calfornia)</h2>
        <p> Over the past few weeks, Yung Pinch has been rolling out a new track every week as part of his #4EverFriday series, and thankfully for fans he doesn't look to be slowing down either. Following releases like “Castaway,” “Nothing Left,” & “Unstable” to name a few, the rising West Coast artist decides to keep his foot on the gas and share another offering today called “When I Get Home (Hotel California).”
            Available below, take a listen to The Atomix-produced record and let use now what you think. If you wish to see Pinch live in person you’re in luck, the LA artist just announced yesterday that he’s about to hit the road this winter for the "Lost At Sea" Tour.</p>

        <h2> Lil Pump ft Lil Uzi Vert - Multi Millionaire</h2>
        <p> On the one-year anniversary of Lil Pump's self-titled debut mixtape, the Florida native reconnected with Lil Uzi Vert once again for the release of his rugged single "Multi Millionaire" on Friday (Oct. 5). The Danny Wolf-produced tune samples Gucci Mane's "Multi Millionaire LaFlare" and is expected to appear on Pump's much-delayed Harverd Dropout project. In my opinion, this uptempo track really went under the radr as both artists deliver there verses very well.</p>

        <p> The 18-year-old kicks off the track with a few special requests for his casket when he dies. "Smash that bitch two times, I ain't know that that's your wife/ And I got hungry for some Wingstop so I took a flight/ If I die, bury me with two bust downs on my wrist/ Drop four mollies on my casket, and three pints of Actavis," he raps. 

        Uzi takes the baton from his "Bankteller" collaborator and carries "Multi Millionaire" toward the finish line with an uptempo verse, alluding to his money-getting ways and an ability to woo just about any girl he pleases. "These moves is nothing, I'm getting that money/ I fucked your lil' bitch, took her right out in London/ I'm gettin' these hunnids, I keep it a hunnid/ You look at my chain and that bitch is so sunny/ This muhfucka cold, it leave ya nose runnin," the Philly-bred artist rhymes.</p>
