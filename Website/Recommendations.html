        <h2> A Love Letter to You 3 By Trippie Redd</h2>
        <h3>The Ohio rapper showcases the benefits of refining a long-running aesthetic while also revealing its main limitation: the looming sense that things are getting a bit stale</h3>
        <p> In the video for “Topanga,” Trippie Redd is dressed as an irreverent pastor, singing about his ability to save his damsel and tote guns. He’s not the kind of vicar to pass around the collection plate; there are pentagrams and animal skulls dispersed throughout. He levitates menacingly, his hair’s an angry shade of crimson, there’s a green serpent here as well. Neat!</p>

        <p>Trippie Redd’s brand of emo rap is similarly hackneyed. That doesn’t stop him from making these consummate odes to heartbreak. But while his sad songs sound a touch more authentic and sensible here, the overall doom-and-gloom shtick is starting to wear thin. A Love Letter to You 3 showcases the benefits of refining a long-running aesthetic while also revealing its main limitation: the looming sense that things are getting a bit stale.</p>

        <p>Trippie Redd’s caterwauling makes his music endearing when it connects and grating when it misses. Since the release of A Love Letter to You 2, he’s tuned-up his emotional screeches to sound a little more soothing and milky. A Love Letter to You 3 begins with “Topanga” that builds a somber soundtrack for Trippie’s most vulnerable-sounding carols yet. He sings about gunplay with newly polished vocals. Gone are the simplistic choruses and general sleaze weighed down his songwriting; in its place is a multi-part refrain that indicates a degree of familiarity with his faults. It quickly establishes a familiar somber mood that gets further excavated throughout the project as he digs into emo rap’s fascination with brandishing pain’s outcomes. The idea isn’t novel but it’s a little more fleshed out than many of his peers.</p>

        <p> Thankfully, he’s not chasing hits, which made Life’s a Trip an uneven slog. A Love Letter to You 3 is a blended affair of melancholy music with a gentle alt-rock atmosphere and plucky guitar strings throughout. “Toxic Waste” blooms smooth and slowly, similar to the slightly more lively “Love Scars 3.” Its consistency, aside from the drowning 808s of “1400/999 Freestyle” which feature a tough guy act from Juice WRLD, lends to its authenticity and flowing nature. Without the potholes, it’s a smoother ride.</p>

        <p> But while consistency can be read as a strong point, it also makes these songs naggingly predictable. This is the third installment of his flagship series and, now, the tortured-soul act is wearing thin. “I Tried Loving” borders on pestering whining with a heartless ode about heartbreak. There’s at least four relationship-ending songs up here and they begin to bleed together after a couple of listens. Without the bright, creative spots, the doom and gloom begin to feel manufactured to adhere to an aesthetic that he seems lost without. This is frightening because when there’s nothing zippy left to snap attention to, interest begins to wane. A Love Letter 3 is hopefully a farewell for Trippie’s puppy-eyed passages. This is a rare case where the music can be technically sound, yet be largely dismissible because there’s no growth. Emo rap is a crowded space with more innovative artists than Trippie; to eat again, he’ll need to change up his hunting style.</p>
        
        <p> Besides some of the negatives, overall its one of his most complete albums, up their with the first Installment of the album series, " A Love Letter to You 1". After all the personal shots from his former friend, 6ix9ine, and his ex girfriend, Ayleks, Trippie Redd proved that he is above beef and produced a good album. </p>

        <h1> Song Recommendations</h1>
            <h2> Octavion - Party Here </h2>
            <p> Octavian was born in France, raised in Southeast London, and first debuted in 2016 with a promising debut mixtape, 22.But the song itself is even more remarkable. Over a minimal, bass-heavy beat that nods subtly toward garage and dancehall, Octavian holds court with a delivery that bridges grime’s hardscrabble tone with the melodic, half-sung style of U.S. pop rap. His voice cracks as he reaches for notes, but this only adds to his everyman charm. He sounds weary beyond his years, almost as if he’s surprised to still be here, when he raps “Me and my team, we know what it means to survive.” “Party Here” is all about juxtaposition—of British and American sounds, somber verses and ecstatic choruses, posturing and introspection. In synthesizing these disparate elements, Octavian has arrived at something that feels vital and new, a sound that, perhaps, Southeast London can call its own.</p>
            
            <p> Overnight, Drake had posted Instagram photos captioned by lyrics from “Party Here,” the 21-year-old singer-rapper’s breakout song, recorded last year in a friend’s living room. A few days later, Octavian’s phone started firing up again after Drake was filmed singing “Party Here” at a Golden Globes after-party. “Your mandem are getting too close/Careful how you approach me and my bros,” the pop star slurred along, jabbing his glass at the lens as Octavian’s anthem blasted in the background.But if Drake’s co-sign spotlighted that freewheeling appeal, it also drilled home Octavian’s belief in independence. “It proves that it’s all possible,” he says cautiously. “But I don’t want anything more from him.” And he stuck to that, with the song video being created with allegedly just £50—a minor miracle, considering how visually rich, colorful, and jubilant the clip is. </p>

        <h2> Tory Lanez - In for it </h2>
        
        <p> Tory Lanez brought his #FargoFridays series back with new heat “In For It”, which was produced by RL Grime. It was also featured as the second track off his 2015 EP, Cruel Intentions. Daystar Peterson, better known as Tory Lanez or sometimes by his alter ego ‘Argentina Fargo’ was born on July 27th, 1992. The name “Tory” comes from Brooklyn rapper Notorious B.I.G. and “Lanez” is a nickname he had when he got “ from playing chicken in street.” Despite hailing from Toronto, Tory was brought up in Miami, Florida; and during his later life, California. Lanez has been rapping since the age of nine.TThroughout his career, he began to sing more than rap, though his singing gets a lot of criticism for his use of autotune. But, this track it works perfect. The autotune works very well with the dark sounding r&b beat. Have a listen for yourself! </p>

        <h2> Yung Pinch - When I get Home (Hotel Calfornia)</h2>
        <p> Listen to Yung Pinch's newest offering "When I Get Home (Hotel California)."
            Over the past few weeks, Yung Pinch has been rolling out a new track every week as part of his #4EverFriday series, and thankfully for fans he doesn't look to be slowing down either. Following releases like “Castaway,” “Nothing Left,” & “Unstable” to name a few, the rising West Coast artist decides to keep his foot on the gas and share another offering today called “When I Get Home (Hotel California).”
            Available below, take a listen to The Atomix-produced record and let use now what you think. If you wish to see Pinch live in person you’re in luck, the LA artist just announced yesterday that he’s about to hit the road this winter for the "Lost At Sea" Tour.</p>

        <h2> Lil Pump ft Lil Uzi Vert - Multi Millionaire</h2>
        <p> On the one-year anniversary of Lil Pump's self-titled debut mixtape, the Florida native reconnected with Lil Uzi Vert once again for the release of his rugged single "Multi Millionaire" on Friday (Oct. 5). The Danny Wolf-produced tune samples Gucci Mane's "Multi Millionaire LaFlare" and is expected to appear on Pump's much-delayed Harverd Dropout project. In my opinion, this uptempo track really went under the radr as both artists deliver there verses very well.</p>

        <p> The 18-year-old kicks off the track with a few special requests for his casket when he dies. "Smash that bitch two times, I ain't know that that's your wife/ And I got hungry for some Wingstop so I took a flight/ If I die, bury me with two bust downs on my wrist/ Drop four mollies on my casket, and three pints of Actavis," he raps. 

        Uzi takes the baton from his "Bankteller" collaborator and carries "Multi Millionaire" toward the finish line with an uptempo verse, alluding to his money-getting ways and an ability to woo just about any girl he pleases. "These moves is nothing, I'm getting that money/ I fucked your lil' bitch, took her right out in London/ I'm gettin' these hunnids, I keep it a hunnid/ You look at my chain and that bitch is so sunny/ This muhfucka cold, it leave ya nose runnin," the Philly-bred artist rhymes.</p>
